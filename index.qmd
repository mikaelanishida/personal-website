Hello! I am a fourth-year Statistics Ph.D. Candidate at the University of California, Irvine. I am currently working with Drs. Daniel Gillen (UCI) and Michelle Nu√±o (USC) on developing statistical methods to increase efficiency while maximizing information on underrepresented populations. I am also a member of the research lab led by Drs. Daniel Gillen and Joshua Grill (UCI), which focuses on applications in Alzheimer's disease recruitment and retention.

My hobbies include swimming, going to the beach, and trying new restaurants.
