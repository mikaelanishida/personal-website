Hello! I am a fifth-year Statistics Ph.D. Candidate at the University of California, Irvine. I am currently working on developing robust methods for censored, time-to-event data. I am mentored by Drs. Daniel Gillen (UCI) and Michelle Nuño (USC), and I am also a member of the research lab led by Drs. Daniel Gillen and Joshua Grill (UCI), which focuses on applications in Alzheimer's disease recruitment and retention.

I am originally from Honolulu, Hawai‘i. My hobbies include swimming, going to the beach, and trying new restaurants.
